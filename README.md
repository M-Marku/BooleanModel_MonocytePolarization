## Description

This study focuses on detecting macrophage differentiation states (noted as M1, M2 and TAM) by applying a Boolean model on 
a literature and data-driven regulatory network. We organize the work into 4 main steps:\
1. Literature and data-driven network inference
2. Boolean model and phenotype (M1, M2, TAM) categorization through unsupervised clustering algorithms
3. Robustness and perturation analysis on the Boolean model
4. Mutations and knock-outs on network components/pathways
