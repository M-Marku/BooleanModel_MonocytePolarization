## Brief description
The Tumour Microenvironment (TME) is the collection of cells in and surrounding cancer cells in a tumour including a variety of immune cells. It often features considerable amounts of myeloid cells, especially neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. In a tumour setting, macrophages cover a spectrum between a tumour suppressive (M1) or tumour promoting (M2) state. The biology of macrophages found in tumours (Tumour Associated Macrophages, TAMs) remains unclear, but understanding their impact on tumour progression is highly important.\
Many factors underlie the large variability in patients’ immune-infiltration patterns and their responses to therapy. Previous work by the group and others highlighted the extent of individual variability in haematopoietic cells in healthy individuals, and currently the group is investigating the relationship between this variability and chromatin 3D structure.

## Steps
This study focuses on detecting macrophage differentiation states (noted as M1, M2 and TAM) by applying a Boolean model on 
a literature and data-driven regulatory network. We organize the work into 4 main steps:
1. Literature and data-driven network inference
2. Boolean model and phenotype (M1, M2, TAM) categorization through unsupervised clustering algorithms
3. Robustness and perturation analysis on the Boolean model
4. Mutations and knock-outs on network components/pathways
